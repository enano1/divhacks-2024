SLLs (sustainably linked loans - terms are tied to borrowerâ€™s sustainability performance based on key performance indicators (KPIs)) are typically made for massive corporations that involve a significant amount of time and resources to finalize upon. However, 60%-70% of business-related carbon emissions are produced by smaller-medium sized companies. We created an application called Pothos, a SaaS solution leveraging Django and OpenAI, allowing small businesses to apply directly for SLLs, automatically come up with terms, and keep track of their SDG performance and standing.


Small businesses need cash. The world needs sustainability. Pothos solves both.
